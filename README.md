- 👋 Hi, I’m @quantumintelligence
- 👀 We explored Data Mining integration with Statistical Process Control inside Intel from 1995 to 2000, and we considered Quantum Intelligence as both an academic work and a business challenge.
- 🌱 We also use big data and AI to select smart bacteria which convert wastes to energy, and we built more than 20 power generation systems in several countries. 
- 💞️ I am testing some financial data which I put it together (I attached some) and I’m looking to collaborate on making Quantum Intelligence more usable. 
- 📫 please leave your comments.
